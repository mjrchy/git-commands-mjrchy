#### Note on Paths   

In this file, directory paths are written with a forward slash as on MacOS, Linux, and the Windows-Bash shell: `/dir1/dir2/somefile`.    


## Basics

1. When using Git locally, what are these?  Define each one in a sentence
   * Staging area - is the area for tracked file by using git command "git add file" to add untracked file to staging area
   * Working copy - is the version of your project that you're currently working on in your local directory.
   * master - is a default branch of the project after cloning from a local repository.
   * HEAD - is a pointer that represents the latest commit in the branch you are currently working on.

2. When you install git on a new machine (or in a new user account) you should perform these 2 git commands to tell git your name and email.  These values are used in commits that you make:
   ```
   # Git configuration commands for a new account
   git config --global user.name "Name"
   git config --global user.email "Email"
   ```

3. There are 2 ways to create a local Git repository.  Briefly descibe each one:
   - Initializing a Repository in an Existing Directory by using git command "git init" in project's directory.
   - Cloning an Existing Repository by using git command "git clone <url>". url is the link of your repository.


## Adding and Changing Things

Suppose your working copy of a repository contains these files and directories:
```
README.md
out/
    a.exe
src/a.py
    b.py
    c.py
test/
    test_a.py
    ...
```     

1. Add README.md and *everything* in the `src` directory to the git staging area.
   ```
   git add README.md src/
   ```

2. Add `test/test_a.py` to the staging area (but not any other files).
   ```
   git add test/test_a.py
   ```

3. List the names of files in the staging area.
   ```
   README.md
   src/a.py
   src/b.py
   src/c.py
   test/test_a.py
   ```

4. Remove `README.md` from the staging area. This is **very useful** if you accidentally add something you don't want to commit.
   ```
   git reset README.md
   ```

5. Commit everything in the staging area to the repository.
   ```
   git commit -m "Commit everything"
   ```

6. In any project, there are some files and directories that you **should not** commit to git.    
   ```
   For a Python project, name *at least* files or directories that you should not commit to git:
      - venv/ or env/ (Virtual Environment Directory)
      - __pycache__/ (Compiled Python Files)
      - .env (Environment Variable File)
   ```


7. Command to move all the .py files from the `src` dir to the top-level directory of this repository. This command moves them in your working copy *and* in the git repo (when you commit the change):
   ```
   git mv src/a.py a.py
   git mv src/b.py b.py
   git mv src/c.py c.py
   git commit -m "Move all .py file from the src directory to the top level directory"
   ```


8. In this repository, create your own `.gitignore` file that you can reuse in other Python projects.  Add everything that you think is relevant.    
   *Hint:* A good place to start is to create a new repo on Github and during the creation dialog, ask Github to make a .gitignore for Python projects. Then edit it.  Don't forget to include pytest output and MacOS junk.



## Undo Changes and Recover Files

1.  Display the differences between your *working copy* of `a.py` and the `a.py` in the *local repository* (HEAD revision):
   ```
   git diff a.py
   ```

2. Display the differences between your *working copy* of `a.py` and the version in the *staging area*. (But, if a.py is not in the staging area this will compare working copy to HEAD revision):
   ```
   git diff --staged a.py
   ```

3. **View changes to be committed:** Display the differences between files in the staging area and the versions in the repository. (You can also specify a file name to compare just one file.) 
   ```
   git diff --staged
   ```


4. **Undo "git add":** If `main.py` has been added to the staging area (`git add main.py`), remove it from the staging area:
   ```
   git reset main.py
   ```


5. **Recover a file:** Command to replace your working copy of `a.py` with the most recent (HEAD) version in the repository.  This also works if you have deleted your working copy of this file.
   ```
   git checkout -- a.py
   ```


6. **Undo a commit:** Suppose you want to discard some commit(s) and move both HEAD and "master" to an earlier revision (an earlier commit)  Suppose the git commit graph looks like this (`aaaa`, etc, are the commit ids)
   ```
   aaaa ---> bbbb ---> cccc ---> dddd [HEAD -> master]
   ``` 
   The command to reset HEAD and master to the commit id `bbbb`:
   ```
   git reset --hard bbbb
   ```


7. **Checkout old code:** Using the above example, the command to replace your working copy with the files from commit with id `aaaa`:
   ```
   git checkout aaaa
   ```
    Note:
    - Git won't let you do this if you have uncommitted changes to any "tracked" files.
    - Untracked files are ignored, so after doing this command they will still be in your working copy.
 

## Viewing Commits

1. Show the history of commits, using one line per commit:
   ```
   git log --oneline
   ```
   Some versions of git have an *alias* "log1" for this (`git log1`).

2. Show the history (as above) including *all* branches in the repository and include a graph connecting the commits:
   ```
   git log --all --graph --oneline --decorate
   ```


3. List all the files in the current branch of the repository:
   ```
   git ls-files
   ```
   Example output:
   ```
   .gitignore
   README.md
   a.py
   b.py
   test/test_a.py
   test/test_b.py
   ```


## Branch and Merge

1. List all the branches in the repository 
   ```
   git branch
   ``` 
2. Create a new branch with the specified name.
   ```
   git branch new-branch-name
   ```
3. Switches to the previous branch you were on.
   ```
   git checkout
   ``` 
4. Merge the changes from the branch-to-merge into the current branch
   ```
   git merge branch-to-merge
   ```


## Favorites

   The git command that I would like to remember is git status because it is important command to know the current state of your working directory and staging area and lists all modified, staged, and untracked. these will inform me what should I do next for the working copy and a local repository.
